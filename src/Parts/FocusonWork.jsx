            Rather than having a one-size-fits-all process, we try to give our people what they need to work their magic and grow.
            We’ve learned that achieving the best results comes from building teams that are richly diverse, and thus able to explore
            problems from a wider set of perspectives. We don’t always agree with each other, but opinion and debate are valued and 
            openly encouraged.
