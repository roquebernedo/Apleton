            If you're joining us in Berlin, we'll help with relocation and paperwork. We’ll even provide you with free German 
            or English lessons. Plus, working in Germany means you can expect comprehensive health insurance for you and your 
            family, as well as generous maternity and paternity leave. Office hours are flexible, but it’s not all work; we have 
            several company and team outings throughout the year as well as a variety of fun, informal small-group activities.
