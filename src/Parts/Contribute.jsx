            Most of us are active musicians, producers, and DJs, and many of us use Live and Push every day. We come from a
            wide range of cultural and professional backgrounds. Some of us have PhDs, some are self-taught, and most of us are
            somewhere in between. What connects us is the shared belief that each of us has the skills and knowledge to contribute
            to something big: helping to shape the future of music culture.
